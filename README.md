# Weather Forecast Web App

This is a simple web application built with Express.js and EJS to check if it will rain tomorrow in a specified city.

## Overview

In this project, I built a website using Express/Node.js platform and integrated  OpenWeatherMap API API from the provided list of public APIs. The website interacts with the chosen API to retrieve and present data in a user-friendly manner.

## Objectives

- Understand how to integrate public APIs into web projects.
- Gain experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming.
- Improve skills in client-server communication using Axios.
- Demonstrate ability to manipulate and present data retrieved from APIs effectively.

## Features
-Check weather forecast for any city
-Responsive design with Bootstrap
-Uses OpenWeatherMap API for weather data

## Usage
-Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for.
-Click on the "Check" button.
-The application will display whether it will rain tomorrow in the specified city.

## Requirements

### 1. API Choice

Chose  OpenWeatherMap API from the provided list, considering its potential to provide meaningful and interactive data. Ensured that the chosen API does not require authentication and is CORS enabled.

### 2. Project Planning

Researched  OpenWeatherMap API, its features, and the data it provides. Planned how to use and present the data in the web application.

### 3. Project Setup

Set up a new Node.js project using Express.js, Axios for HTTP requests, and EJS for templating. Ensured a structured directory and file organization.

### 4. API Integration

Implemented a GET endpoint to interact with  OpenWeatherMap API. Used Axios to send HTTP requests and handle responses.

### 5. Data Presentation

Designed the application to present the retrieved data from  OpenWeatherMap API in a user-friendly way using HTML, CSS, and EJS templating.

### 6. Error Handling

Implemented error handling for the application and API requests. Logged errors and provided user-relevant error messages when necessary.

### 7. Documentation

Included comments throughout the code to explain logic and documented project setup, API integration, data presentation, and error handling.
